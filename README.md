# Simple_CRUD_SPRING
This is a simple Spring Boot project for basic CRUD operations

Step 1: Create a "resources" Directory

In the "src/main" directory of your Spring Boot project, create a new directory called "resources" if it doesn't already exist. This directory will store configuration files like "application.properties."

Step 2: Create "application.properties"

Inside the "resources" directory, create a file named "application.properties." This file will contain all the necessary configurations for JPA and the database. Below is an example configuration for PostgreSQL, but you can adjust it for your specific database system:
# Define the database type (choose either POSTGRESQL or MYSQL)
spring.jpa.database=POSTGRESQL (or MYSQL)

# Specify the platform (e.g., "postgresql" for PostgreSQL)
spring.sql.init.platform=platform name (e.g., "postgresql")

# Database connection URL (replace "localhost," "5432," and "database name" with your database details)
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/database name

# Database username
spring.datasource.username=your database username

# Database password
spring.datasource.password=your password

# Show SQL statements in the console
spring.jpa.show-sql=true

# Configure Hibernate to create tables if they don't exist (use cautiously)
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=create

# Disable contextual LOB creation for PostgreSQL
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.lob.non_contextual_creation=true

lease make sure to replace the placeholders (platform name, localhost, 5432, database name, your database username, and your password) with the actual values for your specific database setup.

These configurations will help your Spring Boot application connect to the database and perform CRUD operations. Make sure to secure your "application.properties" file as it contains sensitive information, especially the database credentials.
